[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Fondesa/Lyra.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Fondesa/Lyra)

Lyra is an open source library for Android that simplify the save and the restore of Android components' state.
Lyra supports automatic save/restore, base coders to serialize/deserialize values in `Bundle`, caching and retrieval of fields. Lyra includes a flexible API that allows developers to customize any aforementioned behavior.

By default, Lyra uses an internal serializer/deserializer for fields, but also provides a utility library to add serialization/deserialization capabilities of [Gson][1].
